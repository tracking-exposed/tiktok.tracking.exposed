### on Tiktok Algorithm analysis 

Algorithm analysis is a mixture of data collection tools, a methodology, and a proper research question. We would never decode the TikTok algorithm, but for us a success looke like a **more informed debate on algorithms, on its impact, dynamics, and power.**

### on Shadowban

Still, in 2022 it is unclear what shadowban is, as every platform implements its version of this subtle form of censorship punishment, and they justify it as part of their business interest. Therefore, **we develop free software tools and methodology to unveil the rightful question of power the presence of this tool should raise.**

### And about us?

We are the [tracking.exposed team](https://tracking.exposed/about): **we want people in control of their algorithm**; the road is long, raising awareness enabling the most independent and distributed form of platform accountability is our current goal.
