# Why ? 

We strongly expects **algorithmic content curation**, as form of power and control, would be used and **abused** in many ways by multiple actors.
**We concentrate** in developing technology to enable healthy discussion and skeptic analysis.
**We commit** in transferring the centralization power to the border of the network.

# What ?

tiktok.tracking.exposed takes its inspiration, methods, experience, and code from [youtube.tracking.exposed](https://youtube.tracking.exposed). This project is motivated by and refers to the [tracking.exposed](https://tracking.exposed) manifesto; the goal is to create [free (libre) software](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex), support a community of analysts and developers, and enable critical analysis of monopolist platforms. This website is on Hugo and mods can be pull-requested on this [repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/youtube.tracking.exposed).
