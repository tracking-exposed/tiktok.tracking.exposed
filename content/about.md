### TikTok Observatory is part of Tracking.Exposed

[Tracking.Exposed](https://tracking.exposed) investigates how social media impact our society. As a non-profit organization we build tools and conduct research to help shape a freer Internet.

### Algorithmic Accountability since 2016

[Our pioneering research](https://tracking.exposed/publications/) on [YouTube](https://youtube.tracking.exposed), [Amazon](https://amazon.tracking.exposed), [Facebook](https://facebook.tracking.exposed) and [PornHub](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed) has been featured in [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/technology/youtube-conspiracy-theory.html), [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/10/tiktok-users-in-russia-can-see-only-old-russian-made-content?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other), [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2020/03/06/videos-complotistes-youtube-a-la-capacite-de-moderer-son-contenu-lorsqu-il-en-a-la-volonte-politique_6032050_4408996.html), in [United Nation](https://undocs.org/pdf?symbol=en/A/73/348) reports and [a letter](https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20YouTube%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf) from the US Congress to YouTube. Our funders include European Commission, Mozilla and Reset.Tech.

### We also investigate TikTok

We wanna hold the platform accountable by:
- Building free-software research tools
- Empowering regulators with technical reports
- Raising public awareness

Since the beginning of 2022 we have released three presentations:
- A [Shadow-banning investigation](/ws22-shadowban-research) in January
- Our [initial results on political shadow-banning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSaNiJRE9u4IDRtIg-0WPrPfAVc_18Rfrm_QZu3tERQkrGBycVLkduj9E-35SOrZXWHnybLObJSqgU1/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
- The TikTok algorithm [commentary](/commentary)

And held a [workshop](/slides/mozfest/) at Mozfest 

### Big Tech spies on you, <br> together we can spy on them

In order to investigate TikTok, we rely on a browser extension which collects the content served by the algorithm. To participate in the data donation and help us study algorithmic amplification and shadow banning:
