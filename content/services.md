### We offer services in four areas:

1. **For academics**, we help design novel research projects to understand the impact of personalization algorithm. This might include 3 to 5 days workshop, or longer research plan.
2. **Strategic litigation**: by combining the strength of GDPR and the innovative aspect of algorithm analysis, we can highlight if, when, and how a platform is abusing personal data. TikTok has room for investigation and enforcement without thinking of new regulations but simply applying a robust European Data Protection Regulation interpretation.
3. For **Media organisations**, we can help design your coverage of the digital aspects of political campaigns, develop tools and visualisations and provide timely expert analysis. 
4. For **Business and innovators**, we advise on the design of personalization algorithms: impact assessment, implementation, and monitoring.

### In offering these services, we bring our own experience and expertise of the issue, as well as a network of experts and practitioners.

If you are interested in working with us, please [get in touch](/contact) with a brief outline of your project.
