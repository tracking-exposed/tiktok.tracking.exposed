### TikTok collection and scraping pipeline

1. Download our [repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex) from github; If you are simply curious, TikTok related code is in the subdirectory `services/tktrex`;
2. Requirements: `yarn`, `node16`, `mongodb5`
3. backend setup: from the root directory `yarn`, then enter `services/tktrex/backend` and try in different consoles: `yarn watch`, `yarn parserv`
3. extension setup: from the root directory `yarn`, then enter `services/tktrex/extension` and try: `yarn build:watch`
