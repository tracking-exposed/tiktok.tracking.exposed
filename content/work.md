### We wanna hold the platform accountable by:
- Building free-software research tools
- Empowering regulators with technical reports
- Raising public awareness

### Research & Knowledge Sharing

Since the beginning of 2022 we have released:
- A [shadow-banning investigation](/ws22-shadowban-research) in January
- Our [initial results on political shadow-banning](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSaNiJRE9u4IDRtIg-0WPrPfAVc_18Rfrm_QZu3tERQkrGBycVLkduj9E-35SOrZXWHnybLObJSqgU1/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
- All our code is [free software](/software)
- And if you're on videos, this is the TikTok algorithm [commentary](/commentary)
- We held also this [workshop](/slides/mozfest/) at Mozfest 2022


### We offer services in four areas:

1. **Academia**, we help design novel research projects to understand the impact of personalization algorithms. This might include 3 to 5 days workshop, or a longer research plan.

2. **Strategic litigation**, by combining the strength of GDPR and the innovative aspect of algorithm analysis, we can highlight if, when and how a platform is abusing personal data. TikTok offers many opportunities for investigation in the framework of the European Data Regulation directives.

3. **Media organizations**, we can help design your coverage of the digital aspects of political campaigns, develop tools and visualizations and provide timely expert analysis. 

4. **Business and innovators**, we advise on the design of personalization algorithms: impact assessment, implementation and monitoring.

### In offering these services we bring our own experience and expertise, as well as a network of experts and practitioners.

If you are interested in working with us, please [get in touch](/about) with a brief outline of your project.
